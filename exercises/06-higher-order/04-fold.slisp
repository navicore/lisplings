; === fold: Reduce a List ===
;
; (fold fn init lst) combines all elements into one value:
;   (fold fn 0 (list 1 2 3))
; computes fn(fn(fn(0, 1), 2), 3)
;
; IMPORTANT: You cannot pass bare operators like + to fold.
; Wrap them in a lambda:
;   (fold (lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 0 (list 1 2 3))  => 6
;
; Your task: Use fold to sum the list.
